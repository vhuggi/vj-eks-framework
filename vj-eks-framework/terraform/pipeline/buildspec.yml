#######This example buildspec file uses the IMAGE_REPO_NAME, IMAGE_TAG, `AWS ##########

#This example buildspec file uses the IMAGE_REPO_NAME, IMAGE_TAG, AWS_REGION, and AWS_ACCOUNT_ID environment variables to build and push the Docker image.
# You can add additional environment variables as needed, such as TF_VAR_stage to specify the stage for Terraform.

#In summary, to incorporate the different stages in your Terraform codebase, you can:

#Create a separate Terraform configuration file for each stage, such as dev/main.tf, acc/main.tf, and prod/main.tf.

#Modify your Jenkinsfile and/or CodePipeline configuration files to use the appropriate Terraform configuration file and stage-specific variables.

#Modify your Terraform code to use the appropriate stage-specific variables, such as the RDS database name and the S3 bucket name.

#Use version control to manage the different stages of your Terraform codebase, and use a branching strategy such as GitFlow to manage changes and releases across the different stages.

#By following these best practices, you can create a scalable and maintainable Terraform codebase that can support multiple stages and environments.
